# Project description
This repository is an android version of the card game "Gwent" from the famous "The Witcher" game series developed by cdprojektred.  
The implementation does not reflect the entire original game, but instead is a stripped down version with less features. Simultaneously, its easier to learn.

## Gwent  
Official game description:
 > GWENT is a card game of choices and consequences, where skill, not luck, is your greatest weapon. Pick a faction, build an army, and wage war against other players across multiple game modes. With hundreds of cards to collect _charismatic heroes, mighty spells and special abilities_ new strategies are always a thought away.
 
Gwent has two players battleing, in a best of 3, for the win. Win a round by scoring more total points in comparison to your opponent.
